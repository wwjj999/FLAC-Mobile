2. **Make your changes** following our coding guidelines
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Submit a pull request** to the `dev` branch

### Translations

We use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/spotiflac-mobile) for translations. To contribute:

1. Visit our [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/spotiflac-mobile)
2. Select your language or request a new one

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK** 3.10.0 or higher
- **Dart SDK** 3.10.0 or higher
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter extensions
- **Git**

### Getting Started

1. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SpotiFLAC-Mobile.git
   cd SpotiFLAC-Mobile
   ```

2. **Add upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/zarzet/SpotiFLAC-Mobile.git
   ```

3. **Use FVM (Flutter Version: 3.38.1)**
   ```bash
   fvm use
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. **Generate code** (for Riverpod, JSON serialization, etc.)
   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

6. **Set up Go environment (Go Version: 1.25.7)**
   ```bash
   cd go_backend 
   mkdir -p ../android/app/libs
   gomobile init
   gomobile bind -target=android -androidapi 24 -o ../android/app/libs/gobackend.aar .
   cd ..
   ```

7. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Building

```bash
# Debug build
flutter build apk --debug

# Release build
flutter build apk --release
```

```

## Coding Guidelines

### General

- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart) guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic

### Formatting

- Use `dart format` before committing
- Maximum line length: 80 characters
- Use trailing commas for better formatting

```bash
dart format .
```

### Linting

Ensure your code passes all lints:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

### State Management

We use **Riverpod** for state management. Follow these patterns:

```dart
// Use code generation with riverpod_annotation
@riverpod
class MyNotifier extends _$MyNotifier {
  @override
  MyState build() => MyState();
  
  // Methods to update state
}
```

### Localization

All user-facing strings should be localized:

```dart
// Good
Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.downloadComplete)

// Bad
Text('Download Complete')
```

To add new strings:
1. Add the key to `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`
2. Run `flutter gen-l10n`
